# <h1> Money_Tracker </h1>

App to track monthly spendings for a couple. 

<h3> Puropse and Functionality</h3>

After recording our spendings in excel and repeating every month the same cacluations I have decided to create this app and automatise this process. 
The app helps to monitor how much money each person spends on a specific catergry and calculates who ows whom for common spending or loans.
The user inputs each purchase (with few additional details) into the app and then in the end of the month they can analyse their spending patterns using various filters, summarys and avareges. They can also calculate everyone's contribution to the common spendings, who paid for someone else's purchase and if there's some money to be returned.

<h3> Technologies </h3>

To built this app I've used below technologies so far:
- Python 3.6
- MySQL 8.0
- Flask 1.1x
- HTML
- CSS

<h3> Status </h3>
